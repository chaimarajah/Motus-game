# Motus-game
## PURPOSE OF THE GAME :
The game is called Motus, and the objective is to guess a hidden word. The user will make attempts to guess the word, and each attempt will be saved along with the corresponding result. The hidden word will be a fixed word chosen by the game.

For example, let's say the hidden word is "lions." If the user's guess is "lotor," the game will provide a response indicating which letters are correct. In the response, "1" represents a correct letter in the correct position, "0" represents a correct letter in the wrong position, and "X" represents an incorrect letter.

So, the response for the guess "lotor" would be "10X0x," indicating that the first letter is correct, the second letter is incorrect, the third letter is correct but in the wrong position, and the fourth and fifth letters are incorrect.
